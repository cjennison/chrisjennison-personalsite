  title: "Engineering Services Page: From Portfolio to Customer Focus",
  description:
    "Complete transformation of an engineering services page from a basic technology list to a customer-focused services showcase with interactive features, strategic positioning, and tangible value propositions.",
  theme: "Strategic UX & Interactive Design",
  duration: "3.5 hours",
  outcome:
    "Completely reimagined the services page from a technology shopping list into a compelling customer-focused experience. Added strategic positioning with Challenge→Solution→Outcome structure, interactive navigation, scroll-triggered animations, and an innovative meta website demonstration that showcases capabilities through the site itself.",

    "Technology lists don't sell services - customer outcomes do. Transforming from 'what tools we use' to 'what problems we solve for you' requires strategic repositioning around customer needs rather than internal capabilities. Real examples with measurable outcomes provide the social proof needed to convert prospects.",

    "Completely restructured the services page from technology-focused to customer-focused. Organized content by customer needs rather than tech stack, implemented Challenge→Solution→Outcome→Real Example structure for each service, added interactive navigation and animations, and created an innovative meta website demonstration.

        "We are going to work on a new design and implementation for engineering services. Here is what I am looking for, we are going to build this and also record this later into our conversations as an example of AI conversations.\n\nSummary:\nEngineering Services page experience needs to change to be focused on customer engineering requirements. Customers looking for my services don't need a shopping list of my technologies, but they want to see physical objects that represent the things they want.\n\nI can build many things, but I want to focus on a few ideas to build experiences on.\n\nFirst we need to build a component to place these experiences and fill them with content.\nThis component should be formatted as such:\nImage or Component on left\nRight side: Title, subtitle, content, technology list\n\nThen we are going to create 4 different experiences to offer as engineering services, but what's important is that these experiences are not it, I want to cover some capabilities and ideate with you on the optimal set of 4 things to show.\n\nHere are my four concepts:\n\nCRM: Internal business tooling to replace costly subscriptions. Custom tailored engineering solutions built for your business. Simple and intuitive engineering.\nBonus: Turn your CRM into a Progressive Web App so it's available as a mobile app for no additional cost.\n\nLifestyle Mobile App using AI (mobile therapist): Build your dream app project for your idea or business. Start with an MVP to make sure it works and is cost effective.\nBonus: Add responsible AI to your idea for a cutting edge advantage while keeping LLM cost down.\n\nSales Agent: Use the full power of AI to build custom agentic experiences for any modality. Refine the experience of creating customer facing agents to get as close to human as possible to automate communication and reach out.\nBonus: Connect phone numbers with Twilio with full engineering compliance.\n\nSupport 10x more users for a healthcare solution: Evaluate an existing coded solution and handle MVP tech debt to take a proof of concept to a full multi-region application. Improve site performance and ensure long term growth potential.\nBonus: Utilize Azure with Kubernetes and Docker to keep services running smoothly.",

        "Here's the thing, not all of these are real experiences. What we are doing here is showing a prospective customer something they don't have but might want that's congruent. These elements do have real things associated with them that we will mention and I will provide some of those details per example:\n\nCRM: We built a custom lightweight CRM for a company who did not want to pay for Salesforce. We custom tailored the solution to only include what the customer needed and needed to pay for. It ended up costing a few dollars a month to run on their own Azure account.\n\nAI powered Therapy app: We built two applications; One was to use AI to quickly assess calorie burn and calorie and micronutrient content of food, and using AI to assess daily health based on user defined health goals. The other was an alcohol moderation tool for reducing consumption using notifications.\n\nSales Agent: We built an automated reach out tool for calling and texting leads for truck driving opportunities at driverfly.co. Truck companies could run campaigns to automatically gauge interest in trucking jobs to ensure recruiters targeted interested and qualified candidates over cold calls.\n\nPlatform at scale: We have performed many scaling operations to both resolve tech debt from overseas engineering shortcomings and then running on updated and auto-scaling infrastructure. This was done for one particular enterprise organization looking to compete with other companies with less offerings, but better performance.\n\nAdjust the language of these accordingly, leaving the portfolio section at the bottom. Don't use exact numbers, just make assertions. We don't want to put in anything we can't prove numerically.",

I understand the strategy - we're positioning these as capabilities we can deliver based on real work we've done, but framed as 'what we can build for you' rather than 'what we built.'
