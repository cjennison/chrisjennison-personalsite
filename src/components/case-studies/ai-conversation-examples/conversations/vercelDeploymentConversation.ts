Let me first assess your application structure and readiness for deployment.\n\n## Application Assessment & Deployment Readiness\n\nBased on my review of your Next.js portfolio website:\n\n### âœ… **Application is Deployment Ready**\n- Next.js 15 with App Router - fully compatible with Vercel\n- TypeScript configuration is correct  \n- Build process works (npm run build succeeded)\n- Modern tooling setup (Biome, Tailwind, Mantine)\n- Proper project structure following Next.js conventions\n- Contact form API route already implemented (/api/contact)\n- Resend email integration configured\n- Comprehensive deployment documentation already exists\n\n### ðŸ“‹ **Manual Steps Required**\n\n**Environment Variables Needed:**\n- RESEND_API_KEY (for contact form emails)\n- CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE (set to 'false' for production)\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n1. Resend account with verified domain (chrisjennison.com)\n2. GitHub repository with latest code\n3. Vercel account\n\nI can see you already have excellent documentation in VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md and RESEND_SETUP.md. The application structure is production-ready.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Verify your GitHub repo is up to date\n2. Check Resend domain verification status\n3. Create/access Vercel account\n4. Connect repo and configure environment variables\n\nWhat's your current status with these prerequisites?",

Here's what we need to do:\n\n## ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified Deployment Plan (No Custom Domain)**\n\n### **Step 1: Update Email Configuration for Vercel Subdomain**\n\nSince you don't have a custom domain, we need to modify your email setup to use Resend's default domain.

Go to your Vercel project dashboard\n2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables\n3. Add the variables above\n4. Redeploy if needed\n\n### **Step 3: Test the Deployment**\n\nOnce deployed:\n1. Test the contact form\n2. Verify emails are received\n3. Once working, optionally set `CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE=false`\n\nAre you ready to set up the environment variables in Vercel?",
