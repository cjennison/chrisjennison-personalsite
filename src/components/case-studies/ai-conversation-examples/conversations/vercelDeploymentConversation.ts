Assume I have no knowledge of devops and deployments. lets go through, step by step, packaging this up and deploying it to vercel. As we work on this, update the conversation you should create for this interaction to show how devops can be achieved using an AI assisted approach.\n\nReview the overall structure of the application, assess the documentation, and tell me what I need to do manually.",

        "I'll help you deploy your Next.js application to Vercel and document this AI-assisted DevOps process. Let me first assess your application structure and readiness for deployment.\n\n## Application Assessment & Deployment Readiness\n\nBased on my review of your Next.js portfolio website:\n\n### âœ… **Application is Deployment Ready**\n- Next.js 15 with App Router - fully compatible with Vercel\n- TypeScript configuration is correct  \n- Build process works (npm run build succeeded)\n- Modern tooling setup (Biome, Tailwind, Mantine)\n- Proper project structure following Next.js conventions\n- Contact form API route already implemented (/api/contact)\n- Resend email integration configured\n- Comprehensive deployment documentation already exists\n\n### ðŸ“‹ **Manual Steps Required**\n\n**Environment Variables Needed:**\n- RESEND_API_KEY (for contact form emails)\n- CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE (set to 'false' for production)\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n1. Resend account with verified domain (chrisjennison.com)\n2. GitHub repository with latest code\n3. Vercel account\n\nI can see you already have excellent documentation in VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md and RESEND_SETUP.md. The application structure is production-ready.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Verify your GitHub repo is up to date\n2. Check Resend domain verification status\n3. Create/access Vercel account\n4. Connect repo and configure environment variables\n\nWhat's your current status with these prerequisites?",

Here's what we need to do:\n\n## ðŸŽ¯ **Simplified Deployment Plan (No Custom Domain)**\n\n### **Step 1: Update Email Configuration for Vercel Subdomain**\n\nSince you don't have a custom domain, we need to modify your email setup to use Resend's default domain. I can see from your `.env.local` that you already have:\n- âœ… `RESEND_API_KEY` configured\n- âœ… `CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE=true` (we'll keep this initially)\n\nYour contact form is already set up correctly - it uses `test@resend.dev` in test mode, which works without a custom domain.\n\n### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel with Environment Variables**\n\n**Environment Variables to Add in Vercel:**\n```\nRESEND_API_KEY = re_YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY_HERE\nCONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE = true\nTEST_EMAIL_RECIPIENT = cjennison92@gmail.com\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard\n2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables\n3. Add the variables above\n4. Redeploy if needed\n\n### **Step 3: Test the Deployment**\n\nOnce deployed:\n1. Test the contact form\n2. Verify emails are received\n3. Once working, optionally set `CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE=false`\n\nAre you ready to set up the environment variables in Vercel?",

Here's what we need to do:\n\n### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Vercel**\n\nYour site is deployed, but the contact form won't work yet because Vercel needs your environment variables. Here's how to add them:\n\n1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard** (vercel.com)\n2. **Click on your project** (`chrisjennison-personalsite`)\n3. **Go to Settings** (in the top navigation)\n4. **Click \"Environment Variables\"** (in the left sidebar)\n5. **Add these three variables:**\n\n| Variable Name | Value | Environment |\n|---------------|-------|-------------|\n| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY_HERE` | Production |\n| `CONTACT_FORM_TEST_MODE` | `true` | Production |\n| `TEST_EMAIL_RECIPIENT` | `cjennison92@gmail.com` | Production |\n\n### **Step 2: Test the Contact Form**\n\nOnce the environment variables are set:\n1. Visit your live site\n2. Navigate to the contact form\n3. Fill it out and submit\n4. Check your email for the test message\n\nHave you added the environment variables to Vercel yet?",
